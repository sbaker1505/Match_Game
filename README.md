### Game Objectives

There are 16 cards and the goal is to find all the matching pairs in a timely matter using the least number of moves. One move is equal to the selection of two cards. Selecting a card will turn it face up. Once a match is found the selected cards will remain face up and non matching cards will revert to being face down.

### Game Scoring

The scoring is graphically shown with 3 solid stars that decrease based on number of moves. For a perfect score or 3 stars **(★★★)** , you will need to match all the cards in under 12 moves. Alternatively, 2 stars **(★★☆)** equals 12 to 15 moves and 1 star **(★☆☆)** equals 16 or more moves.

## Developer Notes

1. The Javascript file utilizes the jQuery library. I have downloaded the jQuery version 3.2.1 file and it is located in the **js** folder.

2. There were some http security issues with Github when trying to use [weloveiconfonts.com](http://weloveiconfonts.com) for the Entypo and Zocial fonts. To fix this, I downloaded the linked url files from the weloveiconfonts [Github](https://github.com/TimPietrusky/weloveiconfonts) and placed them in a folder called **font** and relinked all the necessary paths to those files.

#### Known Bugs

There are currently no known bugs. If you find one, please leave a comment describing the bug.
